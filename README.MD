## Introduction

Brainfuck is a minimalist programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It is known for its extreme minimalism, using only eight commands, and is primarily used for educational purposes and challenges.

This project includes:
- A Brainfuck interpreter.
- A Brainfuck-to-C compiler.
- A Brainfuck-to-Python compiler.
- A suite of tests for the interpreter.

## Features

- **Interpreter**: Execute Brainfuck code directly.
- **Compilers**: Compile Brainfuck code to C or Python for further execution or analysis.
- **Tests**: Run tests to ensure the functionality of the interpreter.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brainfuck-interpreter-compiler.git
cd brainfuck-interpreter-compiler
```

## Usage

### Interpreter

To use the Brainfuck interpreter, run:

```sh
./brainfuck <files>
```

### Tests

To run the tests for the Brainfuck interpreter, execute:

```sh
./test_brainfuck
```

### Compilers

#### Brainfuck to C

To compile Brainfuck code to C:

```sh
./compile_to_c <input_file> <output_file>
```

#### Brainfuck to Python

To compile Brainfuck code to Python:

```sh
./compile_to_py <input_file> <output_file>
```

## Makefile Commands

The following `make` commands are available for convenience:

- **Run Tests**: `make test_brainfuck`
- **Clean Build Files**: `make clean`
- **Compile Brainfuck to C**: `make compile_to_c`
- **Compile Brainfuck to Python**: `make compile_to_py`
- **Build Brainfuck Interpreter**: `make brainfuck`
